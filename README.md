# 🖋️ Operation Incident Simulator (OASIS)
### Repository: `system_meltdown`

**Operation Incident Simulator** is a high-fidelity technical demonstration of interactive web engineering. Built to showcase the "Ready Player One" aesthetic, this project proves the capability of building complex, real-time systems using vanilla JavaScript.

Turning a concept into a reality using AI-assisted development. 🚀

I had a specific vision for a "Ready Player One" style game: a battle for incident resolution and process failures. 🖋️

While I handled the concept, requirement changes, and overall design, I used Gemini / Claude to help me execute the "heavy lifting" of the JavaScript and physics engine. This project was a masterclass for me in how to direct AI to build complex interactive tools.

What I directed the AI to build:

Dynamic Physics: I pushed for a movement style that feels "fluid" rather than stiff, resulting in smooth mouse-tracking and momentum.

Custom Visuals: I designed the logic for "word-based" projectiles and the specific look of the neon-beveled target the shooter hits.

Rapid Iteration: I led the development process through multiple "sprints"—changing the mechanics to a biological defense, and finally to this creative-themed shooter.

This project shows what happens when you combine a clear creative vision with the power of Generative AI.

## 🕹️ Controls
* **Move:** Track mouse cursor (shooter)
* **Action:** Left-Click to fire Graphite Data Pulses
* **Objective:** Prevent the system from being "rubbed out" by corrupted target protocols.

## 👨‍💻 Development
This project was developed as a "Proof of Concept" for modern front-end development, focusing on high-performance rendering without the use of external heavy libraries like JQuery or Three.js.
